# mac-scripts

A collection of bash scripts for macOS (13+), written with the help of ChatGPT. These scripts are designed for automation, cleanup, and general utility tasks tailored specifically to Mac systems.

Most of these scripts focus on terminal-based workflows, cleanup routines, file management, and other daily tasks I’ve wanted to simplify. If I needed a script for something and couldn’t find a solid version already out there, I tried to build one and archive it here for others.

Scripts are written with a "user configuration" section (if applicable) at the top to make it easy to adapt them without digging through logic.

Some scripts are niche, others more broadly applicable. Many are geared toward personal or power user workflows, but they should be accessible enough for anyone comfortable in the terminal.

### Status Notes

Some scripts are fully tested on macOS Ventura or later; others are rough drafts or untested ideas. If a script is untested, I’ll try to mark it clearly in the header.

If you try one out and it works (or doesn’t), feel free to open an issue or a PR with notes or fixes.

### Contributions

Pull requests are welcome. Especially if:
- You improve safety, portability, or performance
- You add a missing script for a common task
- You tested an untested script and want to share results
